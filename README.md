# Sentence Similarity Search Using VectorStore

**This project demonstrates how to use the custom based VectorStore class that is implemented from scratch to efficiently find similar sentences based on their semantic content.**

## Files

- **main.py:** Contains the VectorStore class definition. 
- **app.py:** Demonstrates how to use the VectorStore class for sentence similarity search.
##Example Input
'''
Query sentence:
'''

## Example Output

```
Query sentence:  Mango is the best fruit.
Similar sentences:
mango is my favourite fruit.: Similarity = 0.8165
I eat mangoes.: Similarity = 0.7071
```

## Key Concepts

1. **VectorStore Class:** Provides efficient storage and retrieval of vectors, optimized for similarity search.
2. **Text Vectorization:** Converts sentences into numerical vectors representing their semantic content.
3. **Cosine Similarity:** Measures the similarity between vectors.
